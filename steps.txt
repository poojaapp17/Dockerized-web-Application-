# DOCKERIZED FLASK WEB APPLICATION


# STEP 1: Create a simple Flask application
# app.py contains the Flask web application code.
# It runs a basic web server on port 5000.


# STEP 2: Define application dependencies
# requirements.txt lists the required Python packages.
# In this project, Flask is the main dependency.


# STEP 3: Create a Dockerfile
# The Dockerfile defines how the Docker image is built.
# It uses a Python base image, installs dependencies,
# copies application files, and runs the Flask app.


# STEP 4: Build the Docker image
# This command builds a Docker image named 'flask-app'
# using the Dockerfile in the current directory.
docker build -t flask-app .


# STEP 5: Run the Docker container
# This command runs the container and maps container port 5000
# to host port 5000, allowing browser access.
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app


# STEP 6: Access the application in the browser
# Open the following URL in a web browser:
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/
# Expected Output:
# "Hello! This is a Dockerized Flask App 🚀"
